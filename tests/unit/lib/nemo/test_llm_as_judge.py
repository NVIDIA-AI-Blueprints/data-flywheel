"""Unit tests for ``LLMAsJudge.spin_up_llm_judge``.

These tests ensure the LLMAsJudge correctly orchestrates deployment of a *local*
LLM judge through the ``DMSClient``:

1. When the model is **not yet deployed** the LLMAsJudge should invoke
   ``deploy_model``.
2. When the model is **already deployed** ``deploy_model`` must *not* be
   called.
3. If ``deploy_model`` raises an exception the LLMAsJudge should propagate it
   unchanged so that the hosting process can fail fast.
